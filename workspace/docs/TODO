TODO:
	- implement FULL boolean
	- implement Fs == 4 and make a check
		- l.2708 Fs might need change for implementation
		- Basically, Fs checks have to be implemented to handle Fs==4 with same side boolean variable but 
		  xml file also has to be read correctly to parse the same side boolean correctly. In addition
		  checks have to be modified in read_xml_arch_file to change the default assignment of Fs
	
- build_switchblocks.cpp
	- l.721 -> When commented its making same side
	- 


Full preset topology:
	- read_xml_arch_file.cpp	l.2713	-> Fs might need change for implementation
	- rr_graph_sbox.cpp		l.48	-> Seems to be for bidir
	- rr_graph2.cpp			l.2260	-> Needs to be uncommented for supporting unidir preset 
	- Implement boolean in read_arch_xml_file -> maybe implement 2 version of FULL rather than trying to add same_side boolean in the parsing of arch data
	- Basically, Fs checks have to be implemented to handle Fs==4 with same side boolean variable but

Bidir same side adaptation:
	- build_switchblocks.cpp 	l.483 	-> sanity check to remove (or adapt)
	- build_switchblocks.cpp 	l.775 	-> sanity check to remove (or adapt)
	- rr_graph2.cpp			l.865	-> sanity check to remove (or adapt) but issue only for FAST_SB_COMPUTATION
	- parse_switchblocks.cpp	l.390	-> sanity check to remove (or adapt)
	- OdinII isn't happy about these architectures
	
Testing:
	- Create architecture that is suited for our testing
