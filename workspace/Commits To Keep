Changes to keep:
- libs/libarchpga/src/parse_switchblocks.cpp
- libs/libarchpga/src/read_xml_arch_file.cpp
	- l.2713 might not be needed
- vpr/src/route/build_switchblocks.cpp
	- l.760 might not be needed -> not commenting seems to help but probably need some tweaking as well
	- l.816 needed
	- l.959 might not be needed, just a sanity check for direction of incoming wires
	- 
- rr_graph.cpp
	- l.643, 1279xxx, 1286xxx and 1301xxx might not be needed because I think only applies to predefined architectures
- rr_graph2.cpp
	- l.681 maybe to keep
	- l.2247 and 2262 look important -> ONLY FOR PREDEFINED TOPOLOGY to implement when FULL architecture gets a parameter for allowing same side
- rr_graph_sbox.cpp
	- l.45 might not be needed because only used for predefined topologies -> could modify if people are interested in same side connections
	- l.191 optional but would be nice to edit
	- 
	
	
	

TODO:
	- implement FULL boolean
	- implement bidir drawing AND processing of same side
	- implement Fs == 4 and make a check
		- l.2708 Fs might need change for implementation
		- Basically, Fs checks have to be implemented to handle Fs==4 with same side boolean variable but 
		  xml file also has to be read correctly to parse the same side boolean correctly. In addition
		  checks have to be modified in read_xml_arch_file to change the default assignment of Fs
	
- build_switchblocks.cpp
	- l.721 -> When commented its making same side

NOTE: Some wires end up being unconnected
Unidir:
	- BOTTOM-LEFT no connection
	- TOP-LEFT no connection
	- RIGHT-TOP no connection
	- TOP-RIGHT
	
BIDIR:
	- Right to Top
