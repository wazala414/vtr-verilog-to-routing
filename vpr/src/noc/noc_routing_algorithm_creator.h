/**

 * @brief  This file defines the NocRoutingAlgorithmCreator class, which creates
 * the routing algorithm that will be used to route packets within the NoC.
 * 
 * Overview
 * ========
 * There are a number of different available NoC routing algorithms. This class * is a factory object for the NocRouting abstract class. This class constructs 
 * the appropriate routing algorithm based on the user specification in the
 * command line. The user identifies a 
 * specific routing algorithm in the command line by providing a string
 * (which is the name of routing algorithm).
 * Then the corresponding routing algorithm is created here based on the 
 * provided string.
