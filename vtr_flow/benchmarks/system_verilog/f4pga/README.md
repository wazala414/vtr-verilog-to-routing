# F4PGA SystemVerilog Benchmarks

This folder contains the `button_controller`, `pulse_width_led` and `timer` benchmarks directly copied from the master branch of the F4PGA GitHub repository at commit [cad8afe](https://github.com/chipsalliance/f4pga/commits/cad8afe0842cd73f5b73949fa12eab1fda326055).
The benchmarks are directly copied to avoid dealing with a significant amount of code by adding the F4PGA repository as a subtree to the VTR repository.
The primary purpose of these benchmarks is to utilize them in VTR GitHub CI tests to continuously monitor the functionality of the Yosys SystemVerilog and UHDM plugins.
